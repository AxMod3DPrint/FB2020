This is a rework of the Fusebox 2020 by Culain, which in turn is a rework of the Original Fusebox by AlexY. However at this point, there's not really much left of the mechanical workings of the original design. All the Carriage parts now have push fit bearings opposed to being cable tied. The X and Y Axis have been re-designed from the ground up to allow push fitting of the bearings. The Z axis is still mostly Culain's design, but has been modified to allow push fitting of bearings. 

The Ethos of the Fusebox was to keep parts pricing low, which at the beginning of this project, was the same aim, however, it is now to improve the FB2020 to a point where it's pretty much it's fool proof and highly reliable. I want it to the point where anyone with a set of Allen keys can put it together. I'm happy with the frame rigidity, yes, it's not as rigid as it could be, but I still want to try to keep costs down where possible, by using printed plastic parts this helps a little.

There are 2 versions, the Standard FB2020 and the FB2020 Plus. The Standard has a build volume of 200x200x170 and the Plus has a Build volume of 200x200x275. The Master Branch is the current version, any major changes such as the conversion from 8mm to 12mm rods on the Z axis, the older version will be branched off.
