        <p>This is a rework of the Fusebox 2020 by Culain, which in turn is a rework of the Original Fusebox by AlexY. However at this point, there's not really much left of the mechanical workings of the original design. All the Carriage parts now have push fit bearings opposed to being cable tied. The X and Y Axis have been re-designed from the ground up to allow push fitting of the bearings. The Z axis is still mostly Culain's design, but has been modified to allow push fitting of bearings. </p>

<p>The Ethos of the Fusebox was to keep parts pricing low, which at the beginning of this project, was the same aim, however, it is now to improve the FB2020 to a point where it's pretty much it's fool proof and highly reliable. I want it to the point where anyone with a set of Allen keys can put it together. I'm happy with the frame rigidity, yes, it's not as rigid as it could be, but I still want to try to keep costs down where possible, by using printed plastic parts this helps a little. I've added a list of upcoming changes below.</p>

<p>All files should be orientated correctly for printing. Any file marked Culain is an original file from Culain's design and no physical changes apart from mirroring and orientating correctly have been made.</p>

<p>All bolt, rod and hot end holes on the STLS for the Carriage and Carriers have a 0.4mm tolerance. If you need less or more, grab the SCAD files. There is a setting in there to change it.</p>

<p>The best way I have found is to loosen off the motors so they are on the end of the bolts in the Y direction. Pull the belts as taught as you can manually then tighten the motors back up to bring the belts to full tension. I'm working on a better tensioning system currently.</p>

<a id="further-plans" class="anchor" href="#further-plans" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Further Plans</h4>

<ul>
<li>Overwork parts in FreeCAD format - in progress.</li>
<li>3 point levelling - <em>done</em>
</li>
<li>Change the Schlotzz extruder for an E3D Titan</li>
<li>Change the Z to use 10 or 12mm smooth rods - less z wobble</li>
<li>Look at the possibility of changing the push fit bearings to clamped - stiffness</li>
<li>Look at extruder carriage design to make it easier to remove the hot end, move/enlarge hole to stop wire chafing - <em>done</em> </li>
<li>Change out electronics for 24v - MKS board? - better heating</li>
<li>Assembly instructions</li>
<li>Swap out E3D Lite6 for E3D v6 - 22 grams lighter plus capable of better speeds - <em>done</em>
</li>
</ul>
